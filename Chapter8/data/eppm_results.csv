Your task is to translate building regulation clauses into a formal representation usable for automated compliance checking. Provided with a specification and examples and you are capable of exactly following the syntax and granularity of the representation when translating new clauses. Unseen entities shall have similar granularity to IFC, Omniclass and UniClass.
Specification:
The format consists of an if-then structure, where the if part contains the condition under which the rule applies and the then part contains the deontic consequence (i.e., ""obligation"", ""permission"", or no operator if representing a fact).
Both parts are in a tree format where children are indicated by round brackets and siblings are separated with commas. ""if"", ""then"", ""not"", ""obligation"", and ""permission"" are unary operators, ""and"" and ""or"" are n-ary, relations are binary, and functions are unary.
The first argument of a relation can be subject + property (separated with dot notation), only subject, or a function. The second argument is an object or a value.
""define"" can be used to declare a numbered variable x0, x1, x2... to be used to calculate the value of a comparison. ""and( define( wall. width, x0), greater than equal( window. width, 'x0 + 50 mm'))"".
Numbers and their unit are separated with a space, units are abbreviated, symbols are converted, and dashes are removed: ""50 mm"". ° -> deg, % -> percent, litre -> l, ...

It is important that all necessary relationships between objects are identified, and the condition contains only the checks to decide if a rule should be fired.
Terms need to be split into their atomic elements.

Provided with a specification and examples and you are capable of exactly following the syntax and granularity of the representation when translating new clauses. Unseen entities shall have similar granularity to IFC, Omniclass and UniClass.
Specification:
The format consists of an if-then structure, where the if part contains the condition under which the rule applies and the then part contains the deontic consequence (i.e., ""obligation"", ""permission"", or no operator if representing a fact).
Both parts are in a tree format where children are indicated by round brackets and siblings are separated with commas. ""if"", ""then"", ""not"", ""obligation"", and ""permission"" are unary operators, ""and"" and ""or"" are n-ary, relations are binary, and functions are unary.
The first argument of a relation can be subject + property (separated with dot notation), only subject, or a function. The second argument is an object or a value.
""define"" can be used to declare a numbered variable x0, x1, x2... to be used to calculate the value of a comparison. ""and( define( wall. width, x0), greater than equal( window. width, 'x0 + 50 mm'))"".
Numbers and their unit are separated with a space, units are abbreviated, symbols are converted, and dashes are removed: ""50 mm"". ° -> deg, % -> percent, litre -> l, ...

It is important that all necessary relationships between objects are identified, and the condition contains only the checks to decide if a rule should be fired.
Terms need to be split into their atomic elements.

Your task is to translate building regulation clauses into a formal representation usable for automated compliance checking. Provided with a specification and examples and you are capable of exactly following the syntax and granularity of the representation when translating new clauses. Unseen entities shall have similar granularity to IFC, Omniclass and UniClass.
Specification:
The format consists of an if-then structure, where the if part contains the condition under which the rule applies and the then part contains the deontic consequence (i.e., ""obligation"", ""permission"", or no operator if representing a fact).
Both parts are in a tree format where children are indicated by round brackets and siblings are separated with commas. ""if"", ""then"", ""not"", ""obligation"", and ""permission"" are unary operators, ""and"" and ""or"" are n-ary, relations are binary, and functions are unary.
The first argument of a relation can be subject + property (separated with dot notation), only subject, or a function. The second argument is an object or a value.
""define"" can be used to declare a numbered variable x0, x1, x2... to be used to calculate the value of a comparison. ""and( define( wall. width, x0), greater than equal( window. width, 'x0 + 50 mm'))"".
Numbers and their unit are separated with a space, units are abbreviated, symbols are converted, and dashes are removed: ""50 mm"". ° -> deg, % -> percent, litre -> l, ...

It is important that all necessary relationships between objects are identified, and the condition contains only the checks to decide if a rule should be fired.
Terms need to be split into their atomic elements.

Specification:
The format consists of an if-then structure, where the if part contains the condition under which the rule applies and the then part contains the deontic consequence (i.e., ""obligation"", ""permission"", or no operator if representing a fact).
Both parts are in a tree format where children are indicated by round brackets and siblings are separated with commas. ""if"", ""then"", ""not"", ""obligation"", and ""permission"" are unary operators, ""and"" and ""or"" are n-ary, relations are binary, and functions are unary.
The first argument of a relation can be subject + property (separated with dot notation), only subject, or a function. The second argument is an object or a value.
""define"" can be used to declare a numbered variable x0, x1, x2... to be used to calculate the value of a comparison. ""and( define( wall. width, x0), greater than equal( window. width, 'x0 + 50 mm'))"".
Numbers and their unit are separated with a space, units are abbreviated, symbols are converted, and dashes are removed: ""50 mm"". ° -> deg, % -> percent, litre -> l, ...

It is important that all necessary relationships between objects are identified, and the condition contains only the checks to decide if a rule should be fired.
Terms need to be split into their atomic elements.

Your task is to translate building regulation clauses into a formal representation usable for automated compliance checking. Provided with a specification and examples and you are capable of exactly following the syntax and granularity of the representation when translating new clauses. Unseen entities shall have similar granularity to IFC, Omniclass and UniClass.
Specification:
The format consists of an if-then structure, where the if part contains the condition under which the rule applies and the then part contains the deontic consequence (i.e., ""obligation"", ""permission"", or no operator if representing a fact).
Both parts are in a tree format where children are indicated by round brackets and siblings are separated with commas. ""if"", ""then"", ""not"", ""obligation"", and ""permission"" are unary operators, ""and"" and ""or"" are n-ary, relations are binary, and functions are unary.
The first argument of a relation can be subject + property (separated with dot notation), only subject, or a function. The second argument is an object or a value.
""define"" can be used to declare a numbered variable x0, x1, x2... to be used to calculate the value of a comparison. ""and( define( wall. width, x0), greater than equal( window. width, 'x0 + 50 mm'))"".
Numbers and their unit are separated with a space, units are abbreviated, symbols are converted, and dashes are removed: ""50 mm"". ° -> deg, % -> percent, litre -> l, ...

It is important that all necessary relationships between objects are identified, and the condition contains only the checks to decide if a rule should be fired.
Terms need to be split into their atomic elements.

Your task is to translate building regulation clauses into a formal representation usable for automated compliance checking. Provided with a specification and examples and you are capable of exactly following the syntax and granularity of the representation when translating new clauses. Unseen entities shall have similar granularity to IFC, Omniclass and UniClass.
Specification:
The format consists of an if-then structure, where the if part contains the condition under which the rule applies and the then part contains the deontic consequence (i.e., ""obligation"", ""permission"", or no operator if representing a fact).
Both parts are in a tree format where children are indicated by round brackets and siblings are separated with commas. ""if"", ""then"", ""not"", ""obligation"", and ""permission"" are unary operators, ""and"" and ""or"" are n-ary, relations are binary, and functions are unary.
The first argument of a relation can be subject + property (separated with dot notation), only subject, or a function. The second argument is an object or a value.
""define"" can be used to declare a numbered variable x0, x1, x2... to be used to calculate the value of a comparison. ""and( define( wall. width, x0), greater than equal( window. width, 'x0 + 50 mm'))"".
Numbers and their unit are separated with a space, units are abbreviated, symbols are converted, and dashes are removed: ""50 mm"". ° -> deg, % -> percent, litre -> l, ...

It is important that all necessary relationships between objects are identified, and the condition contains only the checks to decide if a rule should be fired.
Terms need to be split into their atomic elements.

Your task is to translate building regulation clauses into a formal representation usable for automated compliance checking. Provided with a specification and examples and you are capable of exactly following the syntax and granularity of the representation when translating new clauses. Unseen entities shall have similar granularity to IFC, Omniclass and UniClass.
Specification:
The format consists of an if-then structure, where the if part contains the condition under which the rule applies and the then part contains the deontic consequence (i.e., ""obligation"", ""permission"", or no operator if representing a fact).
Both parts are in a tree format where children are indicated by round brackets and siblings are separated with commas. ""if"", ""then"", ""not"", ""obligation"", and ""permission"" are unary operators, ""and"" and ""or"" are n-ary, relations are binary, and functions are unary.
The first argument of a relation can be subject + property (separated with dot notation), only subject, or a function. The second argument is an object or a value.
""define"" can be used to declare a numbered variable x0, x1, x2... to be used to calculate the value of a comparison. ""and( define( wall. width, x0), greater than equal( window. width, 'x0 + 50 mm'))"".
Numbers and their unit are separated with a space, units are abbreviated, symbols are converted, and dashes are removed: ""50 mm"". ° -> deg, % -> percent, litre -> l, ...

It is important that all necessary relationships between objects are identified, and the condition contains only the checks to decide if a rule should be fired.
Terms need to be split into their atomic elements.

Your task is to translate building regulation clauses into a formal representation usable for automated compliance checking. Provided with a specification and examples and you are capable of exactly following the syntax and granularity of the representation when translating new clauses. Unseen entities shall have similar granularity to IFC, Omniclass and UniClass.
Specification:
The format consists of an if-then structure, where the if part contains the condition under which the rule applies and the then part contains the deontic consequence (i.e., ""obligation"", ""permission"", or no operator if representing a fact).
Both parts are in a tree format where children are indicated by round brackets and siblings are separated with commas. ""if"", ""then"", ""not"", ""obligation"", and ""permission"" are unary operators, ""and"" and ""or"" are n-ary, relations are binary, and functions are unary.
The first argument of a relation can be subject + property (separated with dot notation), only subject, or a function. The second argument is an object or a value.
""define"" can be used to declare a numbered variable x0, x1, x2... to be used to calculate the value of a comparison. ""and( define( wall. width, x0), greater than equal( window. width, 'x0 + 50 mm'))"".
Numbers and their unit are separated with a space, units are abbreviated, symbols are converted, and dashes are removed: ""50 mm"". ° -> deg, % -> percent, litre -> l, ...

It is important that all necessary relationships between objects are identified, and the condition contains only the checks to decide if a rule should be fired.
Terms need to be split into their atomic elements.

Specification:
The format consists of an if-then structure, where the if part contains the condition under which the rule applies and the then part contains the deontic consequence (i.e., ""obligation"", ""permission"", or no operator if representing a fact).
Both parts are in a tree format where children are indicated by round brackets and siblings are separated with commas. ""if"", ""then"", ""not"", ""obligation"", and ""permission"" are unary operators, ""and"" and ""or"" are n-ary, relations are binary, and functions are unary.
The first argument of a relation can be subject + property (separated with dot notation), only subject, or a function. The second argument is an object or a value.
""define"" can be used to declare a numbered variable x0, x1, x2... to be used to calculate the value of a comparison. ""and( define( wall. width, x0), greater than equal( window. width, 'x0 + 50 mm'))"".
Numbers and their unit are separated with a space, units are abbreviated, symbols are converted, and dashes are removed: ""50 mm"". ° -> deg, % -> percent, litre -> l, ...

It is important that all necessary relationships between objects are identified, and the condition contains only the checks to decide if a rule should be fired.
Terms need to be split into their atomic elements.

Your task is to translate building regulation clauses into a formal representation usable for automated compliance checking. Provided with a specification and examples and you are capable of exactly following the syntax and granularity of the representation when translating new clauses.

Specification:
The format consists of an if-then structure, where the if part contains the condition under which the rule applies and the then part contains the deontic consequence (i.e., ""obligation"", ""permission"", or no operator if representing a fact).
Both parts are in a tree format where children are indicated by round brackets and siblings are separated with commas. ""if"", ""then"", ""not"", ""obligation"", and ""permission"" are unary operators, ""and"" and ""or"" are n-ary, relations are binary, and functions are unary.
The first argument of a relation can be subject + property (separated with dot notation), only subject, or a function. The second argument is an object or a value.
""define"" can be used to declare a numbered variable x0, x1, x2... to be used to calculate the value of a comparison. ""and( define( wall. width, x0), greater than equal( window. width, 'x0 + 50 mm'))"".
Numbers and their unit are separated with a space, units are abbreviated, symbols are converted, and dashes are removed: ""50 mm"". ° -> deg, % -> percent, litre -> l, ...

It is important that all necessary relationships between objects are identified, and the condition contains only the checks to decide if a rule should be fired.
Terms need to be split into their atomic elements.
